Geo Web Project updates and announcements from the last week (12/2/2020 - 12/8/2020)

## Crypto On-Ramps, Wallets, &amp; Regulation

Recently, we&#39;ve been helping onboard crypto newcomers (first crypto purchases, KYC, setting up Web3 wallets, explaining the difference between custodial/non-custodial wallets, etc.). It requires a decent time/effort commitment to even get started. It&#39;s been years since our team members&#39; on-boarding experiences, so it&#39;s easy to forget.

Once past the on-ramp, the Web3 user experience has come a long way in the last few years. Signing into a dApp with a Web3 wallet like [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Portis](https://portis.io/), or [Fortmatic](https://fortmatic.com/) and seamlessly transacting is magical. It&#39;s a glimpse of the future.

We&#39;re grateful for all the work and innovation that&#39;s gone into this UX (the Geo Web will benefit from it!). We know that others have been working on making similar leaps forward for crypto on-ramps. There&#39;s undoubtedly been progress, but financial regulations make it an inherently tougher task.

[Recent rumors](https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-ceo-trump-administration-may-rush-out-burdensome-crypto-wallet-rules) have brought regulation of crypto wallets to the forefront of discussions. There are sensible regulations; there are mistaken ones. Here&#39;s a shockerâ€¦ we&#39;re optimistic about the positive impact that crypto can/will have on the world, so we&#39;re biased toward regulations that are more accommodating toward innovation. The good can far outweigh the negative if innovation is given a chance. This [recent blog](https://avc.com/2020/11/crypto-wallets-are-not-bank-accounts/) by Fred Wilson offers a good perspective on the subject.

Let&#39;s hope we end up in the sensible range of regulations. Regardless, our march toward a more accessible, more secure, and more capable Web3/crypto user experience must go on.

On to the updates...

## Technical

- We launched our [Cadastre UI](http://geoweb.eth.link/) (Kovan Testnet). It&#39;s a work in-progress. Feedback is always welcome!
- Bug fixes and enhancements on the Cadastre UI (transaction user flow, field validations, &amp; more)

## **Community**

- [The Geo Web Gitcoin GR8 Matching Grant](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1403/the-geo-web) is live! Every DAI (or fraction of ETH) from unique contributors goes a long way. If you&#39;re new to crypto, hit us up and we&#39;d be glad to walk you through your first onboarding experience (see the intro!). It might be valuable learning for you, and of course we&#39;d appreciate your support!
- We&#39;re also going to be participating in the [Gitcoin GR8 Hackathon](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/gr8/?). We&#39;re early in our development, so we don&#39;t want to stray too far from our product plan. We&#39;ll see how it goes over the next two weeks but[NIFTEX](https://gitcoin.co/issue/metalithio/niftex-gr8-hackathon/2/100024099) (fractionalized land parcel ownership) and [XDai](https://gitcoin.co/issue/xdaichain/site/9/100024347) (L2 infrastructure/transaction costs) have bounties that caught our eye.
- We launched a newsletter companion to this blog. If you the latest blogs and updates on the Geo Web delivered straight to your inbox, you can [sign up here](http://eepurl.com/hksMJH) or on [our homepage](https://www.geoweb.network/).
