Principles of the Geo Web project and updates from the last week (1/27/2021 - 2/2/21)

## Principles &amp; Navigating the Storm

There&#39;s always something going on somewhere in the world that&#39;s &quot;crazy&quot; these days. As they say, change is the only constant, so it&#39;s probably always felt this way to people in the moment. But, there&#39;s an objective case that this is a unique era: \&gt;7.6 billion people + hyperconnectivity of the internet. Our world is full of complexity, reflexivity, and velocity that is unmatched in human history.

In the last few weeks, we&#39;ve seen &quot;crazy&quot; situations of political, social, and economic unrest. Just in the US-centric newscycle, we&#39;ve seen the storming of the US Capitol, deplatforming on, and of, social media platforms, and the Wall Street Bets/GameStop/Robinhood fiasco. Disinformation, inequality, and confounding changes are at the forefront of our collective mind.

I&#39;m known amongst my non-industry friends as a &quot;crypto person.&quot; In the last few weeks, I&#39;ve fielded WAY more calls/texts from friends wanting to understand what this whole crypto/blockchain/decentralization thing is all about than ever before. Just like after the Great Financial Crisis and Satoshi Nakamoto&#39;s subsequent work to create Bitcoin, people are searching for new answers to grapple with the changes and injustices they see in the world.

Crypto and decentralization don&#39;t automatically solve all the ills of society or the fallibility of humans. We have been diligently researching, debating, experimenting, and buidl-ing the tools and platforms to address the exact issues that we&#39;re seeing play out though. We still see plenty of greed, power games, and tribalism in cryptoland. We&#39;re not &quot;there&quot; yet, and never truly will be. There will always be unexpected challenges and tradeoffs in the pursuit of better forms of cooperation in a diverse, complex world.

So, how do we weather the inevitable storms in this never-ending pursuit? Principles—establish values that are collectively held and inviolable that serve as a guide to navigate an uncertain future.

We&#39;ve published our first draft of the [Geo Web Constitution](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/governance/blob/main/DRAFT_Constitution.md) to attempt to do just that. It&#39;s not much of a constitution yet (explicit governance functions and rules will come later), but it does lay out initial thoughts on the mission and principles that we&#39;re founding the Geo Web Network on. Our principles are idealistic and probably a bit naive at this point, but we&#39;d rather start from there than the opposite. We&#39;ll continue to iterate through drafts, so these principles aren&#39;t law yet. We hope the spirit of our intent resonates with the community and gives you a clearer picture of where we&#39;re trying to take this network. If you&#39;re interested in helping chart the course, we welcome you to jump in with comments, suggestions, &amp; criticism—rule by decree will never be one of our principles.

On to the updates...

## Technical

- Our [testnet Cadastre](https://geoweb.eth.link/) ([Metamask required](https://metamask.io/download.html), make sure you&#39;re on the Kovan network!) is live with our initial Ceramic Network integration. You can now give your land parcel a name and link arbitrary web content via a HTTP(S), IPNS, or IPFS URI. This starts to show the potential &quot;purpose&quot; to owning land on the Geo Web.
  - Example Use Case: Last week I claimed essentially the whole Manhattan Financial District, renamed it r/wallstreetbets, and [linked the Reddit page to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/)... because why not? Anyone visiting Wall Street and using a Geo Web browser would be taken directly to the digital epicenter of the meme stock resistance. Much cheaper to &quot;own&quot; Wall Street this way IMO, but still requires diamond hands (a sufficiently high For Sale Price) to maintain control of the parcel. Go buy the parcel if you&#39;d like to see something else done with it.

## Community

- Great stuff coming out of the team over at [clr.fund](https://clr.fund/). Their third matching round [recently wrapped up](https://blog.clr.fund/round-3-review/), round 4 will kick off sometime next week, and [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) will utilize a clr.fund instance to allocate $15k in prizes in the Open hackathon track. We haven&#39;t pubbed our participation in these matching rounds because we shilled [Gitcoin GR8](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1403/the-geo-web), so hard, but we did receive a couple contributions and funds. Thanks for the support!
- [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/schedule), [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/apply), [ETHDenver](https://twitter.com/EthereumDenver).
- We&#39;re working on a draft product roadmap to share publicly. We&#39;ve kept admin necessarily light and nimble as we&#39;ve developed the initial product, but it&#39;s time to get a little more formal and communicative to help the community better see the Geo Web vision. The roadmap will lay out the epics we&#39;re targeting in our march to mainnet in 2021.

## On Deck

- Researching solutions for intra-parcel content linking
- Implement a limited Ceramic document hosting service
