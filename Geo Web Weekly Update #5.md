# Geo Web Weekly Update #5

## Timing the AR Market

Timing is a common thread for questions that we get when talking about the Geo Web. When will smartglasses be mainstream? When will augmented reality content be &quot;good enough?&quot; Aren&#39;t those things necessary to do what you&#39;re trying to do?

Over the long-term, yes. The Geo Web vision for an AR metaverse includes field-of-view smart devices and awe-inspiring digital content seamlessly interacting with the real world, but it doesn&#39;t start there.

Our focus is on building and maintaining universal consensus of digital-spatial rights in the physical world. The tools to accomplish that exist todayâ€”global navigation systems, powerful personal computing devices, programmable smart contracts, and effective mechanism design.

Our smartphones go everywhere with us. There&#39;s plenty of opportunity to leverage the Geo Web&#39;s spatial consensus to deliver digital content/information to augment our experiences in the physical world. The Geo Web&#39;s initial use cases don&#39;t need to utilize high-fidelity, spatial renderings (data feeds, webpages, micro-apps, etc.). They may not even be visual (audio!).

The Geo Web&#39;s digital land registry is a &quot;narrow waist&quot; protocol. It&#39;s a point of integration agnostic to use case, hardware, and application software. It&#39;s designed to support innovation above and below itself in the technology stack without breaking or having to recreate it&#39;s consensus as use cases evolve.

To bring it back to the line of questioning that got us started: no one has firm answers on how and when a mainstream AR market will develop. So, we&#39;re not trying to time the market. Smartglasses and high-fidelity AR content will be great on the Geo Web. But with our approach to establishing consensus and the Geo Web&#39;s network effects, there&#39;s only one answer to when to start building and that&#39;s now.

On to the updates...

## Technical

- Continue work on beta Cadastre UI ([cadastre/mvp](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/cadastre/tree/mvp))
- Some large bug fixes in the Geo Web Subgraph ([#7](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/as-geo-web-coordinate/pull/7), [#8](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/as-geo-web-coordinate/pull/8))

## **Community**

- Roblox filed their[S-1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm) IPO prospectus last Thursday. A couple highlights via Twitter:

[&quot;Only 16 uses of the word metaverse in Roblox S-1. According to Edgar only 10 filings in past 5 years with word metaverse. Going to guess that number changes pretty quickly.&quot; - @tweettal](https://twitter.com/tweettal/status/1329586614893309953)

- Metaverses are here. There are more to come. The rules that govern these &quot;platforms&quot; will define our real world relationship not only with technology, but with each other. We&#39;re as bullish as anyone on the potential that these worlds unlock (educational, economic, &amp; creative). That&#39;s why we&#39;re so focused on implementing the Geo Web as an open-source public good that benefits users/society first and foremost.
- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/grants/?) Ethereum Grants Round 8 kicks off on December 2, 2020. We&#39;re preparing to make a big marketing/educational push for the[Geo Web&#39;s Grant](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1403/the-geo-web). We&#39;d love to have your support starting 12/2!

## **On Deck**

- Continue development of the beta Cadastre UI
- Designing testnet applications that gamify/incentivize claiming, transferring, and managing digital land parcels on the Geo Web
