# Geo Web Weekly Update #1

## Hello, World!

Welcome to the first edition of the Geo Web Weekly Update!

For those not familiar, the Geo Web is an open information network navigated &amp; organized with geolocation. On the Geo Web, smart devices resolve geo-anchored digital content through lookups of an authoritative &quot;digital land&quot; registry in a general purpose browser.

The Geo Web shares many of the same founding principles and familiar architectural components as the World Wide Web, but with a novel user experience and mechanism design. The Geo Web capitalizes on the mobile nature of today&#39;s computing devices (and tomorrow&#39;s augmented reality capabilities) to create shared digital experiences in the real world. The Geo Web&#39;s mechanism design makes the network more distributed, egalitarian, and prosocial. Check out this [short demo of Geo Web in action](https://bit.ly/3oH8soy).

We started the project in earnest in July 2020 during [HackFS](https://hackfs.com/) and most recently were part of the [APOLLO Fellowship Program](https://gitcoin.co/blog/apollo/#:~:text=The%20focus%20of%20APOLLO%20is,about%20and%20build%20open%20systems.). We&#39;ve made strong progress with the efficiency and scalability of our Digital Land Registry &amp; SALSA smart contracts over the last few months, so we&#39;re rapidly approaching our beta launch of the network.

Through launch and beyond, we&#39;ll be back here every Tuesday documenting our journey to create the Geo Web. We&#39;re excited to start sharing our progress publicly and hope that you&#39;ll join the conversation!

## Technical Updates

- We launched this website last week! Expect lots of updates to the site as we more fully lay out the vision for the Geo Web.
- We finalized and started implementing the spec for representing land parcels on the Geo Web. Check out the spec [in our Github](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/specs) as well as the beginning implementation of the [smart contracts](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/core-contracts). Feel free to provide feedback and PRs. The Geo Web Project is entirely open source and all contributions are welcome.

## Community Updates

- We wrapped up the 7-week APOLLO Fellowship on Wednesday 10/21 with Demo Day. It was a successful day showing off the Geo Web and checking out other awesome Web 3.0 projects (including several that we&#39;ll hopefully work/integrate with). We highly recommend any aspiring Web 3.0 builders to check out [the curriculum](https://kernel.community/module-0/) that [Andy](https://twitter.com/cryptowanderer) &amp; the folks over at [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) put together for the fellowship: inspiring, deep, and extremely helpful. Thanks to [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) for being a co-sponsor!
- Our Gitcoin grant is live! We&#39;re participating in the Filecoin Liftoff/Apollo matching round (live now) and will hopefully build some momentum going into Grant Round #8 starting on December 2. If you&#39;re not familiar with quadratic funding, check out the [Gitcoin wiki](https://gitcoin.co/wiki/grants/) or the epic [Liberal Radicalism paper (Buterin, Hitzig, Weyl)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656) for a deeper dive. It&#39;s a truly powerful concept. Your small contribution can go a LONG way toward funding public goods like the Geo Web.
- A couple weeks back we had a great chat about Harberger Taxes with [Jason Smythe](https://twitter.com/JasoonSmythe) of [Wildcards.World](https://wildcards.world/) and [Avo Labs](https://avolabs.io/). Jason and his team are using Harberger Taxes (aka SALSA on the Geo Web, aka Always-for-Sale in his worldâ€¦ no one likes &quot;taxes&quot;) in a couple interesting and impactful ways. Check them out and snatch up a Wildcard! If you need any convincing that Jason and the Avo Labs team are doing truly important work, watch[David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64R2MYUt394) on Netflix.

## On Deck

- Research and implementation of Geo Web subgraph on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/). The subgraph will initially be used to show which land parcels are available and unavailable on the upcoming Geo Web Cadastre.
- Beginning the redesign of our prototype [Geo Web Cadastre](http://geoweb.eth.link/) for our beta launch. We&#39;re mostly focused on integrating the new functionality and architecture of our smart contracts, but we&#39;ll implement some styling updates and quality-of-life improvements as well.
