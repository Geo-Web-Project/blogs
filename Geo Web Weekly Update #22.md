# NFTs—More Than Just Art: Weekly Update #22

http://www.geoweb.network/post/weekly-update-22

NFTs aren&#39;t just digital art… plus updates from the last week (3/24/21 - 3/30/21)

## NFTs—More Than Just Art

Back in February, we talked about [NFTs having their first mainstream moment](https://www.geoweb.network/post/weekly-update-17) with [NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) (Dapper Labs also happened to announce a [$305M venture round](https://twitter.com/dapperlabs/status/1376885046120906757) today). Since then, Beeple&#39;s &quot;The First 5000 Days&quot; sold for ~$69M in ETH and SNL did a [spoof rap about NFTs](https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1376032888764960769)… so yeah. Things are pretty wild in the NFT world.

Any time something explodes onto the scene like this, there&#39;s going to be (fair and unfair) skepticism. The two most common criticisms that I hear are versions of &quot;It&#39;s just a JPG!&quot; or &quot;Minting a single NFT is worse for the environment than running a physical art studio for X years!&quot; I&#39;m not going to rehash the arguments about subjective value, deconstruct the social complexities/implications of &quot;ownership,&quot; or talk about the transition to Proof of Stake on Ethereum.

Instead, I simply want to point out that NFTs aren&#39;t just art and collectibles! We&#39;re big believers in those use cases, but they&#39;re just scratching the surface of what NFTs can be and do. We&#39;re obviously quite early in the adoption cycle, so I&#39;m not going to blame SNL for glossing over details, but I don&#39;t even think all crypto natives grok that NFTs can have productive utility and not just speculative value.

[ENS](https://ens.domains/) is well-known in the Ethereum ecosystem, but many don&#39;t seem to recognize that the names themselves are NFTs. They can function as censorship-resistant domain names and human-readable wallet addresses. That&#39;s real utility from an NFT!

We&#39;re especially bullish on this sort of NFT property rights utility because Geo Web land parcels are conceptually similar. The holder of a Geo Web land parcel NFT gets the exclusive right to anchor digital content within the boundaries of the land parcel on our network. It&#39;s like the owner of a domain name getting the right to point to a web page to useful business applications, ecommerce, games, entertainment, and, yes, art.

Linking digital information to an easily discoverable _thing_ or memorable name is powerful, but is just one example of NFT utility. So if you don&#39;t mind being a &quot;Well, actually…&quot; type of person, the next time you hear someone talk about how pointless NFTs are, talk to them about utility. Tell them about the Geo Web and virtual land, how [Uniswap V3 LP positions will be NFTs](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v3/), or that [NFTs can be decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and therefore &quot;own&quot; other NFTs &amp; content](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/CIP/blob/main/CIPs/CIP-94/CIP-94.md). You&#39;ll still get a lot of glazed over eyes, but if they leave the conversation knowing that NFTs aren&#39;t just &quot;expensive JPGs,&quot; I&#39;d call that a win for now.

On to the updates...

## Technical

- We&#39;re putting the finishing touches on our AR Media Gallery publishing functionality. Updates soon!
- We finalized our Q2 development roadmap including v1 Geo Web Browser, lots of Cadastre publishing enhancements, a [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) archival integration, L2 ETH scaling, a documentation site, and mainnet readiness!
- We&#39;re very excited to welcome Vishal ([@10dimensions](https://github.com/10dimensions)) as a core contributor to the project. He&#39;s a AR/VR expert amongst many other interests and talents, so he&#39;ll be leading the spatial browser development to start.

## Community

- [Our Gitcoin GR9 grant](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1403/the-geo-web) wrapped up last week. We had over 1,200 unique contributors and raised over $5,500. Final matching totals are still being tabulated ([Gitcoin &amp; BlockScience are collaborating to review the round for adversarial behavior)](https://medium.com/block-science/deterring-adversarial-behavior-at-scale-in-gitcoin-grants-a8a5cd7899ff). Thank you to all that contributed! We&#39;re excited to have this budget to execute regular SourceCred distributions this next quarter.
- We&#39;re still working with the team over at [POAP](http://poap.xyz/) to mint and issue our GR8 &amp; GR9 supporter badges. We&#39;ll get the claim instructions out as soon as possible.
- Vitalik wrote a great post last week about &quot;[legitimacy](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html)&quot; for open-source/blockchain projects, public goods funding, and NFTs—all subjects near and dear to our hearts and very much aligned with how we see the Geo Web opportunity. Highly recommended read!

## On Deck

- Geo Web Browser development
- Filecoin integration spec&#39;ing
- Start building out a public documentation site
