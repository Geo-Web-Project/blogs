# Myth Becomes Reality: Weekly Update #73

https://www.geoweb.network/post/weekly-update-73

Leaning on writing by Yuval Noah Harari and Vitalik Buterin to explain how the Geo Web narrative can become reality. Plus updates from the Geo Web project (5/26/22 - 6/1/22).

## Myth Becomes Reality

I find myself constantly recommending two pieces of writing: [_Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_](https://www.ynharari.com/book/sapiens-2/) by Yuval Noah Harari and [_The Most Important Scarce Resource is Legitimacy_](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) by Vitalik Buterin. Together they explain how I see the crypto space and why I&#39;m on a team building the Geo Web.

The central claim of Harari&#39;s book is that the reason that humans rule the Earth is our ability to create and maintain shared myths. Money, religion, countries, and human rights are all just \*made up,\* yet they are the foundation of civilization and continued progress.

This idea was transformational for me when I first read it because I had always thought of myself as a staunch &quot;math and logic&quot; person. From a myopic perspective, I thought anything other than cold-hard fact was a distraction. _Sapiens_ helped me realize how naive that was and come to a clearer understanding of the world.

There is undoubtedly an interaction between human narratives and reality as it plays out. Shared myths can even survive the assault of &quot;facts&quot; for long periods of time depending on their memetic qualities and the chain of actions they inspireâ€”for better and worse, intentional or not.

Not enough people understand that yet, and that&#39;s why I love Vitalik&#39;s blog post. It takes this idea of shared myths into an optimistic call to action. The core of legitimacy starts as a shared myth. And as Vitalik frames it, legitimacy can be bestowed as a value-driven choice to drive desirable outcomes. Our ability and desire for shared myths may be innately human, but that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t jumpstart them with conscious choice and design.

That is the story of the Geo Web. Our [partial common ownership](https://docs.geoweb.network/concepts/partial-common-ownership) digital land system is \*made up.\* There is no basis in nature for what we&#39;re proposing (traditional property rights don&#39;t have it either). But, that doesn&#39;t mean the Geo Web can&#39;t overtake those previous myths to drive new, better outcomes. Importantly, we think that we have the necessary feedback loop to pull it off.

We can embrace the lessons from Harari&#39;s studies, take up Vitalik&#39;s call to action, and turn a narrative into reality.

## Technical

- Cody finished the new Edit Parcel panel for the v2 Cadastre ([https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/cadastre/pull/136](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/cadastre/pull/136)).
- Cody is close to finishing an update to how the Cadastre utilizes Ceramic data models ([https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/cadastre/pull/137](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project/cadastre/pull/137)).
- We&#39;re exploring both short-term and long-term AR tech integration opportunities. Strategically the Geo Web digital land registry should stay agnostic to what tech is used to deliver high-fidelity, social AR experiences now and into the future, but we still need to explore and demonstrate the possibilities.

## Community

- Community member Kevvles wrote a great [beginner&#39;s guide to the Geo Web](https://forum.geoweb.network/t/a-beginners-guide-to-the-geo-web/89) and shared it in the forum. We&#39;re excited to see the initiative that Kevvles took on this project because one of the founding values for the project is creating wide, permissionless opportunities. At our early stage, there&#39;s natural friction to start contributing and receiving value in return ([SourceCred is pretty great though!](https://geo-web-project.github.io/sourcecred-instance/#/accounts)). But Kevvles has come into the community eager to contribute and his example will help others follow suit in more ways than one.
- Supporting well-intentioned projects, creators, and public goods in the space is even more important than ever in bear markets. Leighton Cusack recently shared info about [a lawsuit that he is facing for co-creating PoolTogether](https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs/status/1529827211401842694). PoolTogether is on the opposite end of the spectrum from degen DeFi, yet some people want to tear it and Leighton down. Consider [minting a Pooly NFT](https://mint.pooltogether.com/) if you want to help fund his defense.

## On Deck
