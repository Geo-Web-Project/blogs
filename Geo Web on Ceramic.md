The Geo Web is live on Ceramic mainnet, and it feels so good.

## Geo Web on Ceramic

The Geo Web has always been envisioned as a peer-to-peer network. Bucking client-server hegemony will have serious benefits for the network in the long run: censorship resistance, transmission efficiency, and scalability. But, admittedly most p2p content tools for Web 3.0 are in the early stages of development, usability, and adoption.

Luckily for us, we came across[Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/) by[3Box Labs](https://3boxlabs.com/) early in our architecture exploration. Ceramic is a decentralized, open source platform built on[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) that makes creating, hosting, and sharing streams of data a breeze. The team over at 3Box has a track record of innovation, and they&#39;ve delivered again with Ceramic (plus the related projects/tools[IDX](https://idx.xyz/) and[3ID Connect](https://ceramicstudio.github.io/web-playground/)).

We&#39;re super excited to be one of the first projects to launch on Ceramic. Check out this blog from the Ceramic team to learn more about the integration:
