# ETHDenver &amp; Community: Weekly Update #15

weekly-update-15

The Ethereum community and updates from the last week (2/3/2021 - 2/9/21)

## ETHDenver &amp; Community

We&#39;ve been pumping the [ETHDenver Conference/BUIDL-a-thon](https://www.ethdenver.com/) in the blog for well over a month now. It hasn&#39;t disappointed. We&#39;re about half way through the week, and I want to get back to the hackathon, presentations, and the _Virtual Sports Castle_ (metaverse!), so I&#39;m going to keep things short this week.

The people, the work, and the community that I&#39;ve encountered at the conference are inspiring. We&#39;re believers in the power of the technology that underpins the web3 movement, but the community that has sprung up around Ethereum (and related platforms) will be web3&#39;s greatest asset going forward.

We&#39;ve met artists, GIS experts, students, crypto OGs, and first-timers. And to a person, they&#39;re curious, enthusiastic, and committed to building better systems for human collaboration, creativity, and prosperity. Our kind of people!

We&#39;ll leave this week with a few new friends, ideas, and maybe even a Geo Web core contributor or two. It&#39;s hard to imagine asking for more than that from a conference. Although, having a beer in-person with fellow web3 travelers would be nice. Next year.

On to the updates...

## Technical

- Minor [Kovan testnet Cadastre](https://geoweb.eth.link/) fixes (wallet disconnects, IPFS links losing case sensitivity in some browsers)
- ETHDenver BUIDL-ing! Our main hacking focus is on [IDX](https://idx.xyz/) (decentralized identity) from our friends over at [3Box Labs](https://3boxlabs.com/). We&#39;re working through integrations with [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/), [myColorado ID](https://mycolorado.state.co.us/), and a custom physical land ownership &quot;oracle&quot;. We&#39;ll share the final project next week in whatever form it ends up in.

## Community

- I&#39;m a Colorado resident, so I might be biased, but I&#39;ve been so impressed with the vision and work presented by the [Colorado Governor&#39;s Office of Information Technology](http://www.oit.state.co.us/) at ETHDenver. [Governor Jared Polis](https://twitter.com/jaredpolis) has been an active participant throughout the week, and he&#39;s made me a believer that Colorado is going to continue to lead the charge in modernizing all different aspects of government with technology including blockchains, cryptography, and web3 principles.
- Check out [MetaGame](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/) and go down the rabbit hole. They share many of the same principles upon which we&#39;re founding the Geo Web, so I was in the instant I started reading. They are educating, recruiting, and getting people active in the web3 space in such a smart/fun/effective way.

## On Deck

- Back to normally scheduled programming next week
