# What It Is vs. What It Does: Weekly Update #8

Geo Web Project updates and announcements from the last week (12/9/2020 - 12/15/2020)

## What It Is vs. What It Does

I&#39;m guilty of breaking more or less every &quot;rule&quot; for marketing and describing technology like the Geo Web. I&#39;m deeply passionate about the Geo Web: every last detail matters to me. That&#39;s always resulted in taglines and elevator pitches that are overly detailed and technical. I&#39;ve always known that &quot;if you try to say everything, you end up saying nothing&quot; yet the habit persists. It&#39;s just flat out hard to write simple copy for new technology. Real pros are worth their weight in gold.

This week, Cody suggested a simple shift in how we were talking about the Geo Web after a chat with a friend of the project, [Thomas](https://twitter.com/listenaddress) from [Infinite Scroll](https://twitter.com/infinitescroll_). It amounted to talking about what the Geo Web DOES and not what it IS. That&#39;s one of those pieces of advice I&#39;ve ignored before too, but it just clicked this time:

# The Geo Web is a set of protocols &amp; system of property rights for anchoring digital content to physical land.

It&#39;s still a little heavy with the &quot;protocols and property rights&quot; section, but I tried it out on a few non-technical family members, and there were definitely less blank stares. We&#39;ll continue to experiment and evolve our description of the Geo Web. For now we&#39;ll stick with the most fundamental action it enables. Give it a try on your own project if you&#39;ve struggled with this like me (and most other technologists)!

On to the updates...

## Technical

- More updates to the Cadastre UI (Kovan Testnet): field validations, forced transfer transactions, edit parcel details, and additional network fee payments are in!
- Implemented upgradable testnet smart contracts (continuity FTW!)
- Lots of research and hands-on experience with [fiat-to-crypto on-ramps](https://www.geoweb.network/post/weekly-update-7). A product&#39;s initial user experience can be make-or-break. We&#39;re going to be constantly pushing the envelope for an easier onboarding experience for the Geo Web. We&#39;re still a ways away from production (i.e. using real money), but some impactful decisions will still be made quite early.

## **Community**

- We&#39;re in the homestretch of Gitcoin Grant Round 8! It ends at 12pm EST on Thursday 12/17. Thanks to the generous support of 24 donors (and growing), our current total grant is estimated to be over $1,400. If you haven&#39;t yet donated, there&#39;s still time! Right now each 1 DAI contribution nets a 53x match; 10 DAI is 13.7x! [Donate to the Geo Web Gitcoin Grant here.](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1403/geo-web)
- Go check out the latest version of our [Cadastre UI](http://geoweb.eth.link/). You can claim, transfer, and manage digital land parcels with the same mechanics we&#39;ll use in production (but since it&#39;s testnet it functions with free tokens). If you have ideas for use cases that you&#39;d like to explore on the Geo Web hit us up! Making sure our base smart contracts are flexible enough to accommodate use cases far and wide is a huge focus for us now.
- [Clr.fund](https://twitter.com/clrfund) is a quadratic funding (QF) platform for Ethereum public goods (similar to Gitcoin), but with a few [differentiating goals and features](http://clr.fund/#/about). We recently submitted the Geo Web Project to join in on their Round 2 fun! Don&#39;t worry we&#39;re not going to constantly be shilling for donations, but we&#39;re big believers in the power of QF. There are still a ton of challenges to work out, so we want to stay connected with and support those innovators pushing the ideas and ecosystem forward!
